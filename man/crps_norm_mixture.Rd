\title{CRPS for a Mixture of two Normals}
\usage{
crps_norm_mixture(x, mu1, sd1, mu2, sd2, w1 = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of observations for which the CRPS is to be computed.}

\item{mu1}{A vector of expectations of the first normal. Must be of the same length as \code{x}.}

\item{sd1}{A vector of standard deviations of the first normal. Must be of the same length as \code{x}.}

\item{mu2}{A vector of expectations of the second normal. Must be of the same length as \code{x}.}

\item{sd2}{A vector of standard deviations of the second normal. Must be of the same length as \code{x}.}

\item{w1}{A vector of weights between 0 and 1 associated with the first normal.
Must be either of length one, or of the same length as \code{x}.}
}
\value{
A vector of CRPS values.
}
\description{
Computes the continuous ranked probability score
(CRPS) of given observations when the predictive distribution is
a mixture of two normals.
}
\details{
Formula (5) from Grimit et al. (2006) is applied
for the special case of two normals.
